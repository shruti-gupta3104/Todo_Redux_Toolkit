📝 ToDo Web Application using Redux Toolkit
Developed a simple yet functional ToDo web application leveraging Redux Toolkit for efficient state management. The project was built using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the development environment.

🔧 Key Features:
Add ToDo: Users can enter a task, which gets added to the central Redux store via the addTodo reducer.

Remove ToDo: Tasks can be deleted by dispatching the removeTodo reducer, which filters out the task based on its unique id.

🧠 Technical Highlights:
Utilized Redux Toolkit's createSlice to manage todos with minimal boilerplate.

Centralized state configured using configureStore.

Integrated Redux DevTools for debugging and tracking state changes.

Functional components built using React for rendering and updating the UI based on store state.
